Grow
==================

Gradually grow superpixels starting from an initial set.

1. Watersheds
------------------

It use the gradient image, which is seen as a topological surface, and the superpixels are
created by flooding the gradient image. `Watersheds in digital spaces: an efficient algorithm based on immersion simulations <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/87344>`_ 1991.


2. Turbopixels
